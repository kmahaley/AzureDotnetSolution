## How to setup Azure key vault

  - Login to `portal.azure.com` -> select subcription and resource group
  - Create keyvault. Keep note of [keyvaultName] and [keyVaultUrl]
  - Goto `Secrets` tab and add secret [secretName], enter value [secretValue]
  - Goto `Access policy`, make sure you have permissions to key, secret and certificate. If not select you name and  type of permission you want

## How to create Azure Active directory application registration with client secret

  - Goto Azure portal ->Azure active directory ->App registration ->new registartion -> provide name [appRegistartionName] and select single tenant -> create
  - Goto overview of app registration, make note of [tenantId] and [clientId]
  - Goto `Certificate & Secret` ->Add new client secret -> make note of [clientSecret] value

## How to create Azure Active directory application registration with client certificate

  - Create self signed certificate. Using `makecert` https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/seccrypto/makecert
    - Create directory `certificate` and run below commands
    - `makecert -sv privateKey.pvk -n "cn=serviceFabricToKeyVaultAccess" serviceFabricToKeyVaultAccess.cer -b 12/30/2010 -e 12/29/2021 -r`
    - provide password [certificatePassword]
    - Create `.pfx` file using below command. details https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/devtest/pvk2pfx
    - `pvk2pfx -pvk privateKey.pvk -spc serviceFabricToKeyVaultAccess.cer -pfx serviceFabricToKeyVaultAccess.pfx -pi [certificatePassword]`
    - you can obtain thumbprint using powershell command `Get-PfxCertificate "[path]\serviceFabricToKeyVaultAccess.pfx"`
    - Install certificate on your machine. Double click and select .pfx -> install for local machine 
    
  - Goto Azure portal ->Azure active directory ->App registration ->new registartion -> provide name [appRegistartionName] and select single tenant -> create
  - Goto overview of app registration, make note of [tenantId] and [clientId]
  - Goto `Certificate & Secret` ->upload certificate -> select and add .cer file we created inprevious step ->make note of [clientCertificateThumbprint] value
  
***Installing certificate on Azure resource***

  - Install certificates on Azure Virtual machine scale set(VMSS)
    - update VMSS ARM template.
    - https://resources.azure.com/ -> select subscription -> resource group -> providers -> microsoft.compute -> VMSS name -> Put call to update VMSS
    - Add below mentioned json in ARM template VMSS -> virtualMachineProfile -> osProfile -> secrets -> vaultCertificates

```
{
"certificateUrl": "{secret Identifier from keyvault}",
"certificateStore": "My"
}
```
  - After Put call make sure ARM template updated and VMSS are inupdating state
 

## Access Azure key vault using dotnet core

There are 4 ways to access Azure key vault secrets. You can make code behave as following.

#### Using user credentials

 User [ABC] has access to keyvault. User can use Visual studo, visual studio code as credentials to access key vault.
 Check `KeyVaultService.GetSecretAsUserAsync` method
 

#### Using Azure Active Directory(AAD) application with client secret

 If you want to make code independent of user login, use AAD application registration approach.
 
 Refer to section <b>How to create Azure Active directory application registration with client secret</b>`

  - You have [tenantId], [clientId] and [clientSecret] value.
  - Goto azure portal -> select [keyvaultName] -> Access policy -> Add access policy -> select template -> select principal as [appRegistartionName] -> save

 Now you [appRegistartionName] has access to [keyvaultName].

 Check `KeyVaultService.GetSecretAsApplicationUsingClientSecretAsync` method
 

#### Using Azure Active Directory(AAD) application with Client certificate

 If you want to make code independent of user login, use AAD application registration approach.
 Having [clientSecret] is bad coding practice. We can use certificate approach.
 
 Refer to section <b>How to create Azure Active directory application registration with client certificate</b> 

  - You have [tenantId], [clientId] and [clientCertificateThumbprint] value.
  - Goto azure portal -> select [keyvaultName] -> Access policy -> Add access policy -> select template -> select principal as [appRegistartionName] -> save
  
 Now you [appRegistartionName] has access to [keyvaultName]. 

 Check `KeyVaultService.GetSecretAsApplicationUsingClientCertificateAsync` method

#### Using Azure Managed Identity of Azure Resources [Best approach]
